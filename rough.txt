Raw Ideas

Jumping from that cliff
might seem an easy exit,
no-one will care after
a few weeks or months,
Sun will still rise from the East,
and planets will still go
round and round the sun.
But think about your earth,
to whom you were the center
of his whole universe.
It was alive just 'cos of Sun's warmth.
As little as it may feel,
as scattered as it may seem,
but it is all what Earth asks for.
I won't get another friend as special as you.

Life is short so make every effort count.

You saw the vibrant feathers,
but overlooked its pain to carry it.

An immovable unshakable focus into a task is meditation.

Whoever you are
whatever you do
wherever you stay
YOU are innocent my friend.
you deserve all the love in the universe,
but don't demand love,
be the love.


It was just a bad day,
not a bad life.
Please don't quit.


If any of your acquaintances is reading these
they are suicidal or sensitive.
Don't give your advice, just talk to them
or listen. Or just sit next to them in silence.

Be kind for everyone you meet is fighting a hard battle.

It is the possiblity of a dream come true which makes life interesting.

Sochoge nhi to hoga bhi nhi.

But why so serious.

Stop.Breate.Find your solitude.Find your purpose.Then make it true.

Staring into nothingness.

By forgiving you make space for love to prosper,
which removes the clouds of despair and allow the light of happiness to shine upon you.

***************About Death************

whatever one does, right or wrong
people can't accept it unless forced,
they will lie to themselves till death 
but won't accept their actions or inactions 
were wrong. They will convince themselves of
their innocence and but the best part is 
deep inside the truth still prevails.
That is what doesn't let them stay in peace, 
that is what keeps them awake whole night,
thats what makes them smoke endless cigarettes.

No one in the world knows about them,
no court forces them for a trial,
no teacher questions their morality,
no prison keeps them bounded,
but their values.

carrying all this burden upon their shoulders,
men walks onto the stage,
wearing the mask which the audience expects,
puts on a very interesting show,
enters his vanity with jingling pockets but 
couldn't face the demons staring from 
the mirror.
