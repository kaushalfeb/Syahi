Raw Ideas

Jumping from that cliff
might seem an easy exit,
no-one will care after
a few weeks or months,
Sun will still rise from the East,
and planets will still go
round and round the sun.
But think about your earth,
to whom you were the center
of his whole universe.
It was alive just 'cos of Sun's warmth.
As little as it may feel,
as scattered as it may seem,
but it is all what Earth asks for.
I won't get another friend as special as you.

Life is short so make every effort count.

You saw the vibrant feathers,
but overlooked its pain to carry it.

An immovable unshakable focus into a task is meditation.

Whoever you are
whatever you do
wherever you stay
YOU are innocent my friend.
you deserve all the love in the universe,
but don't demand love,
be the love.


It was just a bad day,
not a bad life.
Please don't quit.


If any of your acquaintances is reading these
they are suicidal or sensitive.
Don't give your advice, just talk to them
or listen. Or just sit next to them in silence.

Be kind for everyone you meet is fighting a hard battle.

It is the possiblity of a dream come true which makes life interesting.

Sochoge nhi to hoga bhi nhi.

But why so serious.
