Raw Ideas

Jumping from that cliff 
might seem an easy exit,
no-one will care after
a few weeks or months,
Sun will still rise from the East,
and planets will still go 
round and round the sun.
But think about your earth,
to whom you were the center
of his whole universe.
It was alive just 'cos of Sun's warmth.
As little as it may feel, 
as scattered as it may seem,
but it is all what Earth asks for.
I won't get another friend as special as you.

Life is short so make every effort count.

You saw the vibrant feathers,
but overlooked its pain to carry it.

An immovable unshakable focus into a task is meditation.
