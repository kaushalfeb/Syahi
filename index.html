			Jumping from that cliff<br>

			no-one will care after<br>
			a few weeks or months,<br>
			Sun will still rise from the East,<br>
			and planets will still go <br>
			round and round the sun.<br><br>
			But think about your earth,<br>
			to whom you were the center<br>
			of his whole universe.<br>
			It was alive just 'cos of Sun's warmth.<br>
			As little as it may feel, <br>
			as scattered as it may seem,<br>
			but it is all what Earth asks for.<br>
